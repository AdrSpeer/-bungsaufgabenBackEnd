            <h2>Birth and Family</h2>
            <p>
              Pepe Mujica was born on May 20, 1935 into a farming family, in the
              town of Paso de la Arena, Montevideo. His parents were Demetrio
              Mujica Terra and Lucy Cordano Giorello. He was the first-born of
              the brothers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thanks to his paternal family he has Basque descent, his
              predecessors immigrated to Uruguay in 1840, from Múgica, a
              municipality in the province of Vizcaya. Unlike his mother, who
              has Italian ancestry. The maternal family were Italian immigrants
              from Genoa, Liguria, from the Fontanabuona valley. Like the
              maternal grandparents, the Giorellos.

            <h2>Personal Life</h2>
            <p>
              In 2005, Mujica married Lucía Topolansky, a fellow former
              Tupamaros member, after many years of living together.
            </p>
            <p>
              They have no children and live on a farm owned by Topolansky on
              the outskirts of Montevideo, where they cultivate chrysanthemums
              for sale, having declined to live in the presidential palace or to
              use its staff.

            <h2>Guerilla</h2>
            <p>
              In the mid-1960s, Mujica joined the newly formed MLN-Tupamaros
              movement, an armed political group inspired by the Cuban
              Revolution.
            </p>
            <p>
              In March 1970 Mujica was gunned down while resisting arrest at a
              Montevideo bar; he injured two policemen and was in turn shot six
              times. The surgeon on call at the hospital saved his life.
            </p>
            <p>
              He spended 14 years in prison during the military dictatorship in
              the 1970s and 1980s

            <h2>The world's poorest president</h2>
            <p>
              He won the 2009 presidential election and took office as President
              on 1 March 2010.
            </p>
            <p>
              He has been called "the world's 'poorest' president" because he
              donates around 90 percent of his $12,000 monthly salary to
              charities to help poor people and small entrepreneurs

            <h2>Thoughts of Pepe Mujica</h2>
            <p>
              José Alberto Mujica Cordano, was a man with very marked moral and
              ethical ideals from his youth. Pepe Mujica, a young dreamer and
              philosopher, always demonstrated his beliefs and thoughts with his
              example. His austere lifestyle, free from worldly needs or
              luxuries, was the greatest proof of Mujica’s happiness.
            </p>
            <p>
              He kept his small farm on the outskirts of Montevideo as his
              residence. When he was president of Uruguay he never occupied the
              presidential residence, and as a means of transportation he never
              changed his ’87 Volkswagen beetle model. He demonstrated with
              facts his leftist political beliefs by donating 90% to social
              projects and charitable works.
            </p>
            <p>
              For his personal satisfaction, the last thing on his list of needs
              was material extravagances. For him they were an anchor of true
              happiness, becoming the bars of freedom.
